# sinatra-capybara-template
'Out-of-the-box' template for a sinatra web app with capybara testing framework

## How to get started

1. On the repo home page, click the green 'Use this template' button
2. Github will then ask you the name of the repository you wish to use the template in. (E.G RPS-Challenge)
3. Once you have named your repo, click the green 'Create repository from template' button
4. Github will initialize a new repo for you with the name you chose and include all the sinatra/capybara files and gems required
5. Clone this repo into your text editor

!--IMPORTANT--!
6. Lastly, rspec_helper.rb, config.ru and app.rb all reference the class 'Battle' by default. Please change all instances of the Battle class in the
aforementioned files to whatever class/model you want to work on.
!--IMPORTANT--!

7. You should now be able to use rackup from the terminal to start the server as well as use rspec for both rspec unit tests & capybara feature tests.
8. THAT'S ALL FOLKS!
